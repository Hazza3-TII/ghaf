# TII SSRC Secure Technologies: Ghaf Framework

This repository contains the source code of Ghaf Framework â€” an open-source project for enhancing security through compartmentalization on edge devices.

## Build Instructions

Ghaf utilizes a flake only approach to build the framework. To see provided outputs, type `nix flake show`.


### x86-64

To build the VM-image for x86-64, use:

    nix build .#packages.x86_64-linux.vm

Run the above x86-64 VM-image inside QEMU:

    nix run .#packages.x86_64-linux.vm

or

    result/bin/run-ghaf-host-vm


The development username and password are defined in [authentication module](./modules/development/authentication.nix).

> **NOTE:** this creates `ghaf-host.qcow2` copy-on-write overlay disk image in your current directory. If you do unclean shutdown for the QEMU VM, you might get weird errors the next time you boot. Simply removing `ghaf-host.qcow2` should be enough. To cleanly shut down the VM, from the menu bar of the QEMU Window, click Machine and then click Power Down.


### NVIDIA Jetson Orin (AArch64)

To build for the NVIDIA Jetson Orin, use:

    nix build .#packages.aarch64-linux.nvidia-jetson-orin

Flash the resulting `image eg.` to an SD card or USB drive:

    dd if=./result/nixos.img of=/dev/<YOUR_USB_DRIVE> bs=32M


### Cross Compilation Complications

As there are some packages that are not cross-compilation aware, set the following in your `configuration.nix` to enable binfmt:

    {
      boot.binfmt.emulatedSystems = [
        "riscv64-linux"
        "aarch64-linux"
      ];
    }
